"""This module demonstrates creating a pixel slice in the (x, y)
plane, and then appending layers in the z axis, to create a 3D
voxel lattice, as a precursor for a hexahedral finite element mesh.

This module assumes the virtual environment has been loaded.

Example:

    cd ~/autotwin/automesh
    source .venv/bin/activate

    cd book/examples/unit_tests
    pip install matplotlib
    python figures.py

Ouput:

    The `output_npy` file data structure
