# Command Line Interface

```sh
automesh --help
<!-- cmdrun automesh --help -->
```

## Global Options

Two options apply to every subcommand: `--quiet` and `--log`.

* `--quiet` (`-q`) suppresses the terminal output — the banner, and each
  command's `Reading`/`Meshing`/`Writing`/`Done`/`Total` progress lines — while
  the command still runs normally.

* `--log <FILE>` mirrors that same terminal output into a file, with the
  color escape codes stripped so the file is plain text.  `automesh` inserts a
  local date-time stamp before the file extension, so rerunning a command with
  the same `--log` path never overwrites an earlier log:

  ```sh
  automesh --log run.log mesh hex -i octahedron.npy -o octahedron.inp -r 0
  ```

  ```sh
  Logging to run_2026-07-17T09-30-58-0600.log
  ```

  The stamp is `YYYY-MM-DD` (year-month-day), `T` marking the start of the
  time-of-day, then `HH-MM-SS` (hour-minute-second, local time), followed by
  the local UTC offset `-0600` (six hours behind UTC — Mountain Daylight
  Time, in this example).  Hyphens separate the hour, minute, and second
  instead of the more common `:` because `:` is not a legal filename
  character on Windows.

`--quiet` and `--log` are independent, so `--quiet --log run.log` runs silently
on the terminal while still writing the full log file — useful for scripted or
batch invocations where only a record of the run is wanted.
