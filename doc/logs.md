**Goal:** A command line Rust application that takes a command line argument, the path to a `.yml` file, and represents that yaml data as an internal yaml struct.

  * in `/tests/` folder, the `test_utility.py` has the `test_` prefix so that it is picked up by the `pytest` module.  In that same folder, `npy.py` and `spn.py` have tests, and therein has function definitions with the leading `test_foo` format, but the filenames themselves do not have the `test_` prefix.
- [x] Deployment
  * [crates.io](https://crates.io)
    * [rust binary](https://crates.io/crates/automesh)
    * rust library
  * [PyPI](https://pypi.org)
    * [Python wheel](https://pypi.org/project/automesh/)
- [x] Decisions
  * not require `test_` prefix (as done with Python) for names of Rust test files
  * tell python testing to look at `.py` files in the `tests/` folders, as shown below from the [`pyproject.toml`](../pyproject.toml)
  * stop using `pip install -e .` and instead, use Maturin, which will build the Python wheel (`maturin develop --release --features python`) and then use code from the wheel

```bash
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
python_files = [
  '*.py'
]
testpaths = [
  'tests/'
]
```

```bash
(.venv)  (housekeeping) chovey@s1088757/Users/chovey/autotwin/automesh> pip install -e .

      maturin has panicked. This is a bug in maturin. Please report this
      at https://github.com/PyO3/maturin/issues/new/choose.
      If you can reliably reproduce this panic, include the
      reproduction steps and re-run with the RUST_BACKTRACE=1 environment
      variable set and include the backtrace in your report.

### MRB accomplishments

* I added clap as a dependency and set up a main.rs to run automesh as a binary, i.e.,
`cargo run --release -- -i tests/input/f.npy -o foo.exo`
it automatically changes methods based on IO file extensions, and it fails for now (we don‚Äôt have anything that writes exodus files yet)
* I moved the functionality of the NPY type into the SPN type after realizing that the internal data was essentially the same. Meaning the methods in NPY that read `.npy` files just converted it into SPN equivalent data anyway. So now SPN types can be created from `.spn` or `.npy` files.
* I added the functionality that renumbers the nodes to avoid gaps, I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs working. Itertools is now a dependency so I could use `.unique()`
* Still no nodal coordinates yet, will work on next.

### Where do the different editable installs originate?

```bash
cd ~/autotwin/mesh
source .venv/bin/activate.fish

pip list
Package         Version     Editable project location
--------------- ----------- ---------------------------
atmesh          0.0.7       /Users/chovey/autotwin/mesh
...
numpy           1.26.4

python

import atmesh
print(atmesh)
<module 'atmesh' from '/Users/chovey/autotwin/mesh/src/atmesh/__init__.py'>

import numpy
print(numpy)
<module 'numpy' from '/Users/chovey/autotwin/mesh/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/numpy/__init__.py'>

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install maturin
maturin develop --release --extras dev
# pip install pre-commit # already installed with maturin
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Decision:** Pause use of PyO3 to wrap Rust and expose as a Python function.  Develop a pure Rust command line program, and use as a `subprocess`, e.g.,

```bash
# example
import subprocess

result = subprocess.run([MD5_BINARY, fin], check=False, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
        output = result.stdout.decode("utf-8")
```
