```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install maturin
maturin develop --release --extras dev
# pip install pre-commit # already installed with maturin
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Decision:** Pause use of PyO3 to wrap Rust and expose as a Python function.  Develop a pure Rust command line program, and use as a `subprocess`, e.g.,

```bash
# example
import subprocess

result = subprocess.run([MD5_BINARY, fin], check=False, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
        output = result.stdout.decode("utf-8")
```
